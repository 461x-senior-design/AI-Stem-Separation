Purpose
Provide visibility of progress for the team, project partner, and for the Instructor / TA’s. Ensure all team members are doing their part, and aren’t held back by any issues or blockers.

This first version should not do much beyond showing that you have your tech stack working and source repo functioning. Hello World is fine from a functionality standpoint (or the equivalent for your project). Your project work should also demonstrate each team member's ability to collaborate together (pushing & pulling changes), and integrate/build/test/debug.

IF your team have not settled on an architecture, approach, or set of technologies, take this opportunity to test out different approaches. Cross-platform mobile app? Try a small prototype with Flutter/Dart or React Native. Making a game? Try Unity, Unreal, or Godot. Feel free to experiment with different ideas, patterns, algorithms.. If you go this route, instead of one repo there may be several. In this scenario we do not require a unified source repo until later in the term.

IMPORTANT:  No matter what you and your team are doing at this beginning stage of your project, we want to see all of it coming from good communication, visibility, and full cooperation. Teamwork is KEY and we HAVE to see this in these Progress Reports!
