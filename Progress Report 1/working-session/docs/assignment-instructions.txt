Purpose
This Activity will help you with upcoming design assignments (see Preliminary Design - (Individual) and Design Document (Team)). It can also help with the prototyping phase of the term (see Progress Report #1 and Progress Report #2).

Note: Check out the Exploration: Separation of Concerns for some notes on design choices and philosophy, and Exploration: Choosing Your Technologies for details on how best to approach choosing your technology stack.

Instructions
Review the available Design and Development Activities. Choose an activity from the list to complete this assignment. Details and submission types will vary.

Note:  Make sure to follow the instructions for your activity exactly. See Rubric below.

Note:  Feel free to propose an activity to the Instructor, especially if you're in a research project.

Finally, be sure to credit sources and don't include copyrighted material or images. All academic standards apply.

Instructions for the chosen Activity have clearly been followed. Writing establishes a clear overall theme that pertains to the goals of your chosen Activity. The paper is informative and understandable, and the content is likely to stimulate interest and discussion. Claims are supported by detail sentences and/or citations of credible sources. Images, charts, screengrabs, and other supporting visuals have been supplied IF required by the chosen activity, and are clear and understandable.

THE CHOSEN ACTIVITY IS IN THE TITLE. This is a mostly informal paper, however it should be well-organized for clarity and readability. There are clear headings, sub-headings, and may include listing bullets or tables. All images or graphics have captions. Word count and all other activity recommendations have been followed.

Proof of Concept
Goal: Demonstrate that a critical idea, technology, or approach in your project is technically feasible before committing significant effort.

Steps
Define the Scope & Assumptions
Identify the one or two riskiest assumptions you need to validate (e.g., “Can we integrate API X with Y?”, “Will this algorithm run fast enough on mobile?”).
State why these assumptions matter to project success.
Prototype the Core Feature
Build a minimal but working version that tests only the critical functionality (not the full system).
Document setup steps so your teammates could replicate it quickly.
Keep it focused—avoid polishing UI or adding features outside the test scope.
Run Feasibility Tests
Show evidence that the concept works (e.g., sample data processed correctly, API call succeeds, basic interaction works).
If it fails, explain what you learned and whether there’s a workaround or alternative approach.
Evaluate & Reflect
Summarize results: Did it validate or invalidate your assumption?
Note challenges encountered (technical, performance, integration).
Identify next steps: adopt, modify, or abandon this approach.
What to submit:

Brief report (~200-300 words): feasibility, challenges, next steps.
Screenshots (or short screen-recording) of the prototype in action.
Optional: short setup instructions so others can try it.
